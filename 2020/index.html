                            Recommendation systems are used widely in eCommerce industries and multimedia content
                            platforms to provide suggestions that a user will most likely consume; thus,
                            improving the user experience. This motivates people in both industry and research
                            organizations to focus on personalization or recommendation algorithms, which has resulted
                            in a plethora of research papers. While academic research mostly focuses on the performance
                            of recommendation algorithms in terms of ranking quality or accuracy, it often neglects
                            key factors that impact how a recommendation system will perform in a real-world
                            environment. These key factors include but are not limited to: data and model scalability,
                            model
                            serving latency, model interpretability, and resource limitations, such as budget on compute
                            and memory resources, engineering workforce cost, etc.

                            The gap in constraints and requirements between academic research and industry limits the
                            broad applicability of many of academia’s contributions for industrial recommendation
                            systems.
                            This workshop aspires to bridge this gap by bringing together researchers from both academia
                            and industry. Its goal is to serve as a platform via which academic researchers become aware
                            of
                            the additional factors that may affect the chances of algorithm adoption into real
                            production systems, and the performance of the algorithms if deployed. Industrial
                            researchers will also
                            benefit from sharing the practical frameworks at an industrial level.

                      <li>With the rising prevalence of smart mobile phones in our daily life, online ride-hailing platforms have emerged as a viable solution to provide more timely and personalized transportation service, led by such companies as DiDi, Uber, and Lyft.  These platforms also allow idle vehicle vacancy to be more effectively utilized to meet the growing need of on-demand transportation, by connecting potential mobility requests to eligible drivers.  In this talk, we will discuss our train of research on ride-hailing marketplace optimization at DiDi, in particular, order dispatching and driver repositioning.  We will show single-agent and multi-agent RL formulations and how value function can be designed to leverage different amount of information and also facilitate knowledge transfer.</li>

                      <li>Rapid progress in deep reinforcement learning has produced stunning achievements in controlled environments, yet many challenges arise when attempting to apply such methods to real-world RL problems.  Using examples from Facebook, I will discuss several problems faced by practitioners who aim to apply RL to their own situations.  These include issues with problem specification, safety, off-policy evaluation, deployment, validation, and human factors.  I will present recent work from my group which address these concerns: counterfactual inference, deep Bayesian modeling, Bayesian optimization, and opinionated tooling.</li>

                      <li>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal phase in the progression from normal aging to dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease. Even though there is a mild cognitive decline in MCI patients, they have normal overall cognition and thus is challenging
 to distinguish from normal aging. Using transcribed data obtained from recorded conversational interactions between participants and trained interviewers, and applying supervised learning models to these data, a recent clinical trial has shown a promising
 result in differentiating MCI from normal aging. However, the substantial amount of interactions with medical staff can still incur significant medical care expenses in practice. We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework to train an efficient dialogue
 agent on existing transcripts from clinical trials. Specifically, the agent is trained to sketch disease-specific lexical probability distribution, and thus to converse in a way that maximizes the diagnosis accuracy and minimizes the number of conversation
 turns. We evaluate the performance of the proposed reinforcement learning framework on the MCI diagnosis from a real clinical trial. The results show that while using only a few turns of conversation, our framework can significantly outperform state-of-the-art
 supervised learning approaches.</li>

                      <li>What does Boltzmann have to do with Missing Data? I will take us on a journey connecting Boltzmann distribution and partition functions with importance weighting for learning better softmax functions in recommenders, and then further to reinforcement learning, where we can plan better explorations using off-policy correction with policy gradient approaches.  These techniques enable us to reason about missing data features, labels, and patterns from our data.
