                            Recommendation systems are used widely in eCommerce industries and multimedia content
                            platforms to provide suggestions that a user will most likely consume; thus,
                            improving the user experience. This motivates people in both industry and research
                            organizations to focus on personalization or recommendation algorithms, which has resulted
                            in a plethora of research papers. While academic research mostly focuses on the performance
                            of recommendation algorithms in terms of ranking quality or accuracy, it often neglects
                            key factors that impact how a recommendation system will perform in a real-world
                            environment. These key factors include but are not limited to: data and model scalability,
                            model
                            serving latency, model interpretability, and resource limitations, such as budget on compute
                            and memory resources, engineering workforce cost, etc.

                            The gap in constraints and requirements between academic research and industry limits the
                            broad applicability of many of academia’s contributions for industrial recommendation
                            systems.
                            This workshop aspires to bridge this gap by bringing together researchers from both academia
                            and industry. Its goal is to serve as a platform via which academic researchers become aware
                            of
                            the additional factors that may affect the chances of algorithm adoption into real
                            production systems, and the performance of the algorithms if deployed. Industrial
                            researchers will also
                            benefit from sharing the practical frameworks at an industrial level.

                    <p> As registered attendees, you must have received the email from KDD conference regarding the log-in information to the virtual conference. 
                        Here is the link which will lead you directly to the workshop: <a href="https://kddvirtual2020.vfairs.com/en/hall#booth-41201"> IRS2020 </a>
                        and here is the link to the chat room of IRS2020: <a href="https://kddvirtual2020.vfairs.com/en/chat?cid=41201"> IRS2020 Chat Room </a>. You can also search for the workshop using the keyword "irs2020" in the search box on top of the virtual conference page. 
                        We will announce the main zoom link to the workshop in the chat room on or before August 24, 2020.  
                        Invited keynotes and oral presentations will be given in the main zoom link, and the poster sessions will be hosted seprately with one zoom link for each poster. The zoom links will be shared within the chat room as well. We will also update the website to share the zoom links before the workshop. It is recommended that speakers would join the zoom room at their allocated time slot and attend the QA after their presentation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to reduce the risk of network interruptions, pre-recorded videos of the presentations will be played via zoom, if the video is available. Otherwise, the speaker will deliver the talk live. For poster sessions, the authors will determine their format of presentation of their work in the provided zoom link (slides/poster/short video, etc). In general, it is recommended that people watch the pre-recorded video first and join the poster session for Q&A.

                    is a Professor at the Department of Computer Science &
                    Engineering at the University of Minnesota in the Twin
                    Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, and a Senior Principal
                    Scientist at Amazon AWS. He is renowned for seminal
                    contributions in the areas of data mining, recommender
                    systems, and high-performance computing. He has brought his
                    innovative research ideas into practice via a wide-range of
                    high-quality software packages, such as CLUTO and the METIS
                    family of serial and parallel partitioning systems. His
                    software has been incorporated into well over 200 different
                    commercial software systems used by millions of people
                    worldwide and in several hundred academic and government
                    codes. Some notable companies using his work include Amazon,
                    Netflix, Spotify, and Comcast. He has also authored and
                    co-authored a large number of highly cited papers in these
                    areas on topics related to clustering, graph mining, pattern
                    discovery, collaborative filtering, and graph
                    partitioning. Google Scholar shows over 72,000 citations to his work and his h-index is 94.
                    He has received numerous awards including the "IEEE ICDM 10-Year Highest-Impact Paper Award" for
                    his work that developed computationally efficient algorithms to mine large graph databases.
                    He also recently resceived IEEE ICDM Research Contributions Award, which is IEEE’s highest
                    recognition for research achievements in Data Mining.
                    Furthermore, he received the International World Wide Web Conference's "Seoul Test of Time Award"
                    for his work that pioneered an entirely new way of
                    building recommender systems that exploit relations between items.

                            the gap between the two communities, we extremely welcome submissions
                            on industrial recommendation system infrastructures based on given resources, models and

                            end-to-end systems that have been deployed in real world production. <b>All accepted papers will be posted on 
                            the workshop website and will not appear in the KDD proceedings. Selected papers will be presented as contributed talks. </b>

                            The workshop accepts long papers (limited to 9 pages), short papers (6 pages), posters (4
                            pages), abstracts and demos (2 pages). Paper submission and reviewing will be following the
                            directions of the KDD main conference. Reviews are <b>not double-blind</b>, and author names
                            and affiliations should be listed. Submissions should include all content and references
                            within the limited pages, and must be in PDF format and formatted according to the new
                            Standard ACM Conference Proceedings Template. For LaTeX users: unzip acmart.zip, make, and
                            use sample-sigconf.tex as a template. Additional information about formatting and style
                            files is available online at: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.

                            In addition, authors can provide an optional two (2) page supplement at the end of their
                            submitted paper (it needs to be in the same PDF file) focused on reproducibility.
