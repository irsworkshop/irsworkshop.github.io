                            Recommendation systems are used widely in ecommerce industries, multimedia content platforms 
                            and social networks to provide suggestions that a user will most likely consume or connect; 
                            thus, improving the user experience. This motivates people in both industry 
                            and research organizations to focus on personalization or recommendation algorithms, 
                            which has resulted in a plethora of research papers. While academic research mostly focuses on 
                            the performance of recommendation algorithms in terms of ranking quality or accuracy, 
                            it often neglects key factors that impact how a recommendation system will perform 
                            in a real-world environment. These key factors include but are not limited to: 
                            business metric definition and evaluation, recommendation quality control, 
                            data and model scalability, model interpretability, model robustness and fairness, 
                            and resource limitations, such as budget on computing and memory resources, 
                            engineering workforce cost, etc.. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="large text-muted">
                            The gap in constraints and requirements between academic research and industry limits the
                            broad applicability of many of academia’s contributions for industrial recommendation
                            systems.
                            This workshop aspires to bridge this gap by bringing together researchers from both academia
                            and industry. Its goal is to serve as a platform via which academic researchers become aware
                            of
                            the additional factors that may affect the chances of algorithm adoption into real
                            production systems, and the performance of the algorithms if deployed. Industrial
                            researchers will also
                            benefit from sharing the practical frameworks at an industrial level.

                        is a Professor at the Department of Computer Science &
                        Engineering at the University of Minnesota in the Twin
                        Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, and a Senior Principal
                        Scientist at Amazon AWS. He is renowned for seminal
                        contributions in the areas of data mining, recommender
                        systems, and high-performance computing. He has brought his
                        innovative research ideas into practice via a wide-range of
                        high-quality software packages, such as CLUTO and the METIS
                        family of serial and parallel partitioning systems. His
                        software has been incorporated into well over 200 different
                        commercial software systems used by millions of people
                        worldwide and in several hundred academic and government
                        codes. Some notable companies using his work include Amazon,
                        Netflix, Spotify, and Comcast. He has also authored and
                        co-authored a large number of highly cited papers in these
                        areas on topics related to clustering, graph mining, pattern
                        discovery, collaborative filtering, and graph
                        partitioning. Google Scholar shows over 72,000 citations to his work and his h-index is 94.
                        He has received numerous awards including the "IEEE ICDM 10-Year Highest-Impact Paper Award" for
                        his work that developed computationally efficient algorithms to mine large graph databases.
                        He also recently resceived IEEE ICDM Research Contributions Award, which is IEEE’s highest
                        recognition for research achievements in Data Mining.
                        Furthermore, he received the International World Wide Web Conference's "Seoul Test of Time
                        Award"
                        for his work that pioneered an entirely new way of
                        building recommender systems that exploit relations between items.
